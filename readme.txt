## Project Scope:

Malls are often indulged in the race to increase their customers and making sales. To achieve this task machine learning is being applied by many malls already.

It is amazing to realize the fact that how machine learning can aid in such ambitions. The shopping malls make use of their customersâ€™ data and develop ML models to target the right audience for right product marketing.


**Your role:** Mall Customer data is an interesting dataset that has hypothetical customer data. It puts you in the shoes of the owner of a supermarket. You have customer data, and on this basis of the data, you have to divide the customers into various groups.

**Goal:** Build an unsupervised clustering model to segment customers into correct groups.

**Specifics:** 

* Machine Learning task: Clustering model 
* Target variable: N/A 
* Input variables: Refer to data dictionary below
* Success Criteria: Cannot be validated beforehand
